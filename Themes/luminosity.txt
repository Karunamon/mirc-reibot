luminosity 1.4 by zioxide
-------------------------
luminosity is a theme created for MTS 1.1 by zioxide.  I created it after seeing some nice themes on screenshots on various mirc websites, and I even got the colors for the beach theme from a screenshot of JOKRKNEX.
luminosity consists of the default scheme, 'midnight', and seven schemes: 'beach', 'lunar', 'ice', 'desert', 'autumn', 'stone', and 'black ice'.  A new version with more schemes will be available soon.  To use, just extract to your themes directory, run your mts engine, and select the theme.  Enjoy!

Nicklist coloring has been added in the newest version, and to get the full effect of it, you should edit your kte.mrc file.
All you need to do is find line 651 in the original kte.mrc, which reads this:
  var %h = Kte_Theme, %modes = Owner .;Op @;HOp % $+ ;Voice +, %i = 1, %t = $numtok(%modes, 59), %cl, %cllist
Just change it to include the rest of the modes, like:
  var %h = Kte_Theme, %modes = Owner ~;Owner .;Protect &;Admin &;Op @;HOp % $+ ;Voice +, %i = 1, %t = $numtok(%modes, 59), %cl, %cllist
(If you have modified kte.mrc and this line is not on line 651, just search for "alias -l kte_apply_colors_modes", it is the second line of that alias.
