        <h1>ReiBot for mIRC 7.x</h1>

<p>ReiBot is a mIRC-based IRC bot (but more accurately, a collection of scripts which, when combined, has bot-like behavior). Since mIRC provides a robust event handling system for everything from messages to socket connections, as well as a powerful scripting language, it is ideal for writing an automated IRC bot.</p>

<h2>Current Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>A definitions system</li>
</ul><p>A method to retrieve information based on triggers. For instance, if you want to save your channel rules to recall later, the conversation would look like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;You&gt; !learn Rules Don't whiz on the electric fence!
&lt;ReiBot&gt; *Profile Stored*
&lt;You&gt; ?? Rules
&lt;ReiBot&gt; Don't whiz on the electric fence!
</code></pre>

<p>ReiBot was originally written to store character profiles for a role playing channel - hence why the word Profile is used; but don't let this stop you from using it for whatever you want!</p>

<p>There is also a script included which can import definitions from Icel, an Eggdrop TCL script with a similar definitions system.</p>

<p>ReiBot uses mIRC's INI handler to manage the definitions file - We've tested it with more than 500 profiles and the system remains responsive. The format looks like:</p>

<pre><code>[Profile Name]
1=First Line of the profile
2=Second line of the profile.. and so on
WhoSet=Nickname of who did the !learn
SetTime=Last updated datestamp in long format
</code></pre>

<h2>Planned Features</h2>

<p>ReiBot is in active use by me, and therefore active development. Here's what's on my radar.</p>

<p>Priority 1 is probably going to be in the next release. Priority 5 will be done in my copious free time :)</p>

<ul>
<li>A public commands system (Priority: 1)</li>
</ul><p>For channel management, etc. If you can do it with private messages to ChanServ, you'll be able to do it in channel with a simple trigger. This system is going to be coded around Anope services intially (as that's what my home IRC network uses), but I hope to make it compatible with most services backends out there.</p>

<ul>
<li>Remote Access (Priority: 3)</li>
</ul><p>Remotely access files and perform actions on the host system.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Markov-chain chatterbot (Priority: 5)</p></li>
<li><p>Note system (Priority: 2)</p></li>
<li><p>Channel Games (Priority: 5)</p></li>
</ul><h2>Installing</h2>

<ol>
<li> Make a fresh install of mIRC version 7 or greater. I suggest using c:\Reibot, but anything will work.</li>
<li> Clone this repository into the mIRC folder.</li>
<li> Change your mIRC options as you see fit</li>
<li> <strong>(Important!)</strong> Edit the aliases file to change the bot's master control password! </li>
</ol>
